# The-Sparks-Foundation 

Repository containing tasks involved in the Data Science and Business Analytics internship for the [The Sparks Foundation](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-sparks-foundation/) .

## Task1: Prediction using Supervised ML 
1. Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours              
2. Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data
3. What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?


## Task2: Prediction using Supervised ML
1. From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters
and represent it visually.
2. Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

## Task6: Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
1. Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
2. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to
predict the right class accordingly.
